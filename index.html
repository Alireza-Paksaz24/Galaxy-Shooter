    <h1>Unity Course Notes</h1>
    <h3>1. Introduction </h3>
    <p>Nothing really !</p>
    <h3>2. Galaxy Shooter</h3>
    <p>This section only interduce us to Project</p>
    <h3>3. Project Setup</h3>
    <p>use pro mode for interface.</p>
    <h3>4. Create the player</h3>
    <p>
      1. in Main camera, you could change background color. the default setting for Clear Flags is Skybox.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. one of the best way to apply movement and speed, is Translate method in transfor class. this method get one input and that is a vector for new position. you could use this input : Vector3 * speed * Time.deltatime.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. GetAxis, is a method from Input class that return 0 till 1 float number that shows how much player press the button. GetKey, is a method that return boolean, shows if player press the key or not.
    </p>    
    <h3>5. Shooting</h3>
    <p>
      1. the way you could add prefabs as a GameObject in code: [SerializedField] private GameObjcet _name; => then use inspector view and drag prefabs to it.
      2. use Instantiate method to create a prefab object. The method is already inheritances from MonoBehaviour class.
      this method have many differace input but the one we use is (prefabs,position(vector3),Quaternion.identity (as a rotation))
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Another method from MonoNehaviour class is Destroy. we could input gameObject that we want to destroy. we could pass another param that shows after how long hameObject will be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Time.time : the time that passed from when game started / Time.deltaTime: time passed from 2 frame. 
    </p>
    <p>
      5. You could apply change in single prefab to all. just you have to do select overrides in Inspector view of prefabs. 
    </p>
    <h3>6. Enemy</h3>
    <p>
      1. we can use Random class from MonoBehavior and Range for creating rendom float number (float A = Random.Range(10.0f,20.0f);)
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There is 2 type of collision. hard surface collision and trigger. the hard surface happend when 2 object are collide with eachother. like 2 car crashed. but trigger is when 2 object detect that they are collide but it doesn't affact the movement. like collecting the coin in super Mario.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. How to create a tag? at the top of inspector view, select 'tag' and choose 'add tag'. then, you can use 'other.tag' in the OnTerrigerEntr to understand what is object.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. How to get component? other.transform.GetComponent&lt;component&gt;()
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The GameObjcet who wants to detect collition have to have a rigidbody.
    </p>
    <h3>7. Spawn Manager</h3>
    <p>
      1. This course show us how to use coroutine to have a routin in our game such as spawn Enemy. this is how you could use a coroutin.
      <p>
       1.1. first of all, we need a method with IEnumerator method. this kind of method can have special return type called 'yield return'. this return type means that this methid stops for amount of time and start continue other stuff. and after
       times passed, game return to this method and do the rest of method.
       <p>
        1.2. return type of IEnumerator method: new WaitFor...();
       </p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We can use GameObjcet.Find to find a object in game view. example: GameObjcet.Find("Player").GetComponent<Player>()
    </p>
    <p>
      3. how to set parents of GameObject? using {Game-Object-Name}.transform.parents
    </p>
    <h3>8.  Prototype to Production</h3>
    <p>
      1.
